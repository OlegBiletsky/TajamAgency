# The Tajam Creative Agency Landing Page

This repo houses the assets used to build the Harley Davidson website, available at  .

## Languages & Tools
The website is built and developed using the [HTML5](https://medium.com/search?q=html5)(semantic and valid layout) markup language, [CSS3](https://medium.com/search?q=css3) (cascading style sheets), and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/guide) preprocessor scripting language  ([Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world](https://sass-lang.com/)).

For compile/transpile SCSS files to CSS files I used [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
